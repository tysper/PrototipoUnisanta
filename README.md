# Prototipe Unisanta
This project is an interdisciplinary one, with the goal of expanding knowledges and also contributing with society with the subjects learnt in this semester.

The Main goal is to create a Progressive Web App that is capable of communicating with an ESP32 used to get camera feed, then process this camera feed in the application, and speak to the user.

The current libraries and materials being used are:
<ul>
    <li>ESP32</li>
    <li>OV240 Camera Module</li>
    <li>Arduino Uno</li>
    <li>Tesseract.js</li>
</ul>

We want to make the best out of this project so if you have any suggestion please let me know ❤️.
